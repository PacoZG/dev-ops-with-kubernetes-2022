## Submission

My submission for this task is in the following repo: [https://github.com/jeknom/flux-example](https://github.com/jeknom/flux-example). Basically just followed the example in this section so it's not really my "cluster configuration" as the task is requesting in the description. More about that in the feedback section below.

## Feedback about this section

I have not been keeping up a cluster per say which could easily be gitopsified. What I have done is for each exercise I setup the necessary configurations and then spin up the cluster with those. Because of this, I felt super confused about what is meant by "move your cluster configuration to GitOps". I don't really understand this exercise. The following makes more sense because I should move the course todo project to gitops.

Overall, I struggled quite a bit with this section and it would have been better if the concepts behind Flux could have been explained in small exercises. Now it feels that there is this huge dump of information and then you are just chucked straight to the deep end.
